# Next.js Pok√©mon App - Favorite Pok√©mon Manager

It utilizes the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) to obtain detailed information about each Pok√©mon, employing a Static Site Generation (SSG) approach and dynamic routes to optimize performance.

## Technologies Used

- **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (v13.1.1)**: React framework for web applications.
- **[React](https://reactjs.org/) (v18.2.0)**: Library for building user interfaces.
- **[@nextui-org/react](https://nextui.org/)**: UI component library.
- **[Axios](https://axios-http.com/)**: HTTP client for making requests to the PokeAPI.

## Features

1. **Pok√©mon List**: Displays the first 151 Pok√©mon from the first generation. Each Pok√©mon in the list includes an image and its name. Clicking on a Pok√©mon navigates to a details page.

2. **Pok√©mon Details Page**:

   - Detailed information about each Pok√©mon, including sprites from different poses and versions.
   - Favorite button to add/remove the Pok√©mon from the favorites list.
   - Confetti visual effect when adding a Pok√©mon to favorites.

3. **Favorites Page**: Displays all the Pok√©mon that the user has added to favorites. Allows users to remove Pok√©mon from the favorites list from this view.

4. **Dynamic Routes**:
   - Access Pok√©mon details by **name** (`/name/[pokemon_name]`) and by **ID** (`/pokemon/[id]`).
   - Redirects to a custom error page if the Pok√©mon does not exist.

## Application Structure

- **`/pages/index.tsx`**: Main page, shows the list of Pok√©mon. Uses SSG to optimize performance when loading the list.
- **`/pages/pokemon/[id].tsx`** and **`/pages/name/[name].tsx`**: Pok√©mon details pages, accessible by ID or name. Implements SSG with dynamic routes and daily updates to keep the information current.
- **`/pages/favorites/index.tsx`**: Favorites page, shows the Pok√©mon that the user has selected as favorites.

## Integration with PokeAPI

This application connects to the PokeAPI to obtain detailed data about Pok√©mon, such as names, types, abilities, and sprites. Thanks to this integration, the application can display updated information about each Pok√©mon and provide an interactive and dynamic experience for users.
